Part 2: App Idea
App Name: GreenRewards - Track, Earn, and Transform

GreenRewards is a mobile application designed to motivate individuals and households to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their carbon footprint. The app's core feature is a user-friendly interface that allows users to track their daily energy consumption activities, such as energy usage at home and during transportation. Users can input data from their energy bills, as well as simple metrics like AC usage and miles driven.

The app implements a reward system where users earn points for their sustainable behaviors. These points can be redeemed for various rewards, including gift cards, discounts on eco-friendly products, and exclusive merchandise. GreenRewards partners with startups and larger businesses in the renewable energy industry to sell the aggregated and anonymized energy consumption data collected from users. The funds generated from selling this data are used to provide direct funding, free merchandise, and products at reduced prices, which are then redistributed to app users.

GreenRewards also aims to build a community around sustainability by offering a social platform within the app. Users can connect with like-minded individuals, share tips and experiences, participate in challenges, and celebrate their progress in living greener lives. The app fosters a sense of collective passion and responsibility for the environment, creating a positive and supportive space for users to interact and inspire each other.

The goals of GreenRewards are to drive sustainable solutions by providing data to companies and government agencies for scientific innovation, reduce carbon emissions through a bottom-up approach that employs incentives, encourage voluntary adoption of sustainable lifestyles by making alternatives more affordable, support businesses with sustainability missions by distributing their products, and build a strong community around sustainability to accelerate the transition to a carbon-neutral future.

By gamifying sustainable living, providing tangible rewards, and fostering a sense of community, GreenRewards aims to empower individuals and households to make a real difference in mitigating climate change and transitioning towards a greener future.



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
When I tried to add additional function, changing the color of texts, I was a bit lost in connecting the labels to an IBOutlet. After searching it up online, I finally found the answer and it turned out to be pretty similar as I did with the button. I also accidentally found that my "change texts" button also change the color of the background, so I spent a few more time debugging it.
